<br>

<p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px"><I>In <i>1852</i>, John Turnbull Thomson, a British civil engineer have made proposal that a reservoir be built from the headwaters of the Singapore Creek. However, there insufficient support from the officials and public interest. The plans for a reservoir was put aside until the appearance of Mr Tan Kim Seng, a Straits Chinese merchant whom donated $13,000 in <i>1857</i> for improvements to be made for Singapore's waterworks. In <i>1864</i>, official approvals and funds was granted for the construction of a damn for the collection of water. With 3 years of construction, the reservoir was completed in <i>1867</i> calling it <strong>The Impounding Reservoir</strong>.In <i>1877</i> the construction was officially completed with proper set of pumps and distribution network. The Impounding Reservoir was then renamed to <strong>Thomson Road Reservoir</strong> in <i>1907</i>. Due to the <em>massive</em> increase of water demands in <i>1891</i>, plans were proposed to expand the reservoir under the direct supervision of Municipal Engineer James MacRitchie.In <I> 1922 </I>, the reservoir was then renamed <strong>MacRitchie Reservoir </strong>to honour the works from Mr James MacRitchie.</I><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_MacRitchie"> <I>[James MacRitchie]</I> </a></strong>
